bigfloat library for Python

This repo provides instructions for building the Python bigfloat library. The source code for bigfloat is available at:

https://github.com/mdickinson/bigfloat

A functioning mingw-w64 compiler (http://http://mingw-w64.org) and the msys2 environment (https://www.msys2.org/) are necessary for being able to build the Windows binaries for the Python bigfloat library.

The bigfloat binaries for Python 3.7 are provided as a community service.
